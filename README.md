### Real-Time-Hand-Sign-Recognition-System

___

### Applications
- **Sign Language Translation**: Facilitate communication for the hearing impaired by translating sign language into text or speech.
- **Gesture Control**: Enable gesture-based control systems for devices and applications.
- **Interactive Systems**: Enhance human-computer interaction in gaming, virtual reality, and other fields.
### Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include more hand signs and variations.
- Improve model robustness against different backgrounds and lighting conditions.
- Explore the integration of multimodal inputs, such as combining hand signs with facial expressions for more comprehensive recognition systems.
